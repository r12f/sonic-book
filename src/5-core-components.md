# Core Components

In this chapter, we take a deeper look at some of the representative core components in SONiC and their workflows from a code perspective.

```admonish note
For helping us to read and understand, all the code shown here will be simplified to its core part to illustrate the process. If you would like to read the full code, please refer to [the original code in the repository](./3-1-code-repos.html).

Additionally, the relevant file path of the code will be shared in the beginning of each code block, which is based on the SONiC's main repository: [sonic-buildimage](https://github.com/sonic-net/sonic-buildimage). If the code is not imported by buildimage repo, the full URL will be provided.
